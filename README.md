Busy-Bee
GA Project #1

Technology used:
This short trivia game was built with HTMl, CSS, JQuery, and Bootstrap. I used mainly JQuery to manipulate how elements appear on the page. Start with buttons visible, then have the buttons disappear while the board shuffles and generates. I also used Bootstrap to make the page responsive down to cell phones.

Approach taken:
Busy Bee began with the goal of making a short trivia game that would introduce users to plants that helpful to include in their garden. I quickly ran into the problem that bees like most plants, and are amenable to most things that aren't pesticides and fire, so the game switched to things that bees aren't amenable to since that array was smaller.

I talked with Erin about adding complexity to my game, but spent much longer than I anticipated adding smaller details like SweetAlerts, a simple scoreboard, and getting the images centered correctly.

Cool things:
There are now categories available in game by clicking a button - which forced me to make my code much more extensible in the future. Although it's a bit of pain to collect images (hence the Bryce Hates Benedict game being much shorter), this trivia could expand to many different styles of play.

Unsolved problems:
Potential future features: 
A high score board, return to choose trivia type, more types of trivia, cycle through images only once, more unified scoreboard, timer, element fades out on click, media query centering, more beautiful.
